# Notes / Ideas

## Hide 'n' Seek
Hide and Seek gamemode for GTFO

#### Functionality
* Teams!!
  * Seekers
  * Hiders
* hiders switch to team seekers on death
* prevent WE from executing 
* Toggle for Helmet Lights maybe?
* grace period for hiders to hide
* track times
* prevent respawn zones
* prevent sleeping enemy spawns
* change (vanity) colors of seekers to something recognizable
  * maybe slightly glowing?
* auto open all doors
  * skip checkpoint scans if possible
  * maybe restrict areas based on config files?
    * => Keep some doors closed with the interact disabled
    * => or invisible wall with no entry sign shader ala TF2 respawn rooms
* seekers can bop hiders with their melee (oneshot?)
* (idea) automatic hint system after x amount of time?
* (idea) limited use ammo for seekers firearms; -> single mag of sniper ammo
* (idea) user definable invisible walls to block off illegal areas

#### UI
* abuse objective stack for seeker/hider display
* auto reveal map
* Team Colors as player colors?
* disable player ghosts
* for Seekers
  * hide names of non teammates
  * hide non teammate players on map
  * hide non teammate players on compass
* for Hiders
  * names set to world space (not see through walls)
  * hide all other players on map
  * hide all other players on compass

#### Tools
* Tripmine as a security sensor
  * player walks through and it plays an alarm noise / highlights on map?
* Angry Sentry for area denial
  * Only targets hiders (lower damage maybe?)
* cfoam to slow down hiders?
