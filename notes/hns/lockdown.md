## Area Lockdown

* host is able to 'lockdown' a zone pre-game by standing in it

### Method

- Just close the door again :derp:
- invisible wall (plane)
    * pro: would allow lockdown of new areas dynamically without requiring an insta-kill?
    * Collision
        * allows traversal *from* Out-Of-Bounds back inside through the barrier but not outside
    * Visual
        * Bioscan-esque wall inside of the door

### Potential Issues

* Zone doors not aligned with the grid could be somewhat annoying to implement, depending on method
